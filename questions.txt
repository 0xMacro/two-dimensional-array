Look at the following fragment of a contract:
```
    contract EventsAndArrays {

        string[3] public v;
        string[] private w;
        string[][3] private x;

        struct Voter {
            uint weight;
            bool voted;
            address delegate;
            uint vote;
        }

        Voter[] private y;
        
        event MsgSent(address indexed sender, string message);
        event NoteAdded(string indexed summary, string detail);
    }
```
1. Describe each of v, w, x and y. For instance what type is it, what type of data can be stored in it, how much data can it hold, who can see it, and will the values be held in memory or storage?

2. Look at the events. What data will be recorded in them? Where will they be stored and who or what can see them? What are the effects and tradeoffs of marking a string field with the `indexed` keyword?
